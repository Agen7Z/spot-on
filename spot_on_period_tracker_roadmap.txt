SPOT ON — PERIOD TRACKER (MERN)

PRODUCT GOALS - Predict menstrual cycle using previous data - Show
current cycle phase - Send reminders for next period and ovulation -
Provide secure user accounts and persistent dashboard - Responsive
mobile-friendly UI

USER WORKFLOW - Unlogged user lands on landing page with product
overview - User signs up or logs in - After login user sees personal
dashboard - Returning users open dashboard automatically if session
exists

CORE FEATURES - Cycle prediction engine based on historical cycles -
Cycle phases: Menstrual, Follicular, Ovulation, Luteal - Period and
ovulation reminders - Symptom and mood tracking - Calendar visualization
of cycles - Health insights and trends - Profile settings and
notification preferences - Data export and account deletion

OPTIONAL IMPROVEMENTS - Irregular cycle handling - Fertility window
estimation - Dark mode - Multi-device sync - Offline support

TECH STACK (MERN) Frontend - React - Context API or Redux - Chart
library for visualization

Backend - Node.js - Express.js - JWT authentication - Scheduled jobs for
reminders

Database - MongoDB Atlas

DATABASE SCHEMA

User - _id - email - passwordHash - cyclePreferences -
notificationSettings - createdAt

Cycle - _id - userId - startDate - endDate - cycleLength -
predictedNextPeriod - createdAt

DailyLog - _id - userId - date - symptoms - mood - notes

Reminder - _id - userId - type - schedule - enabled

CYCLE PREDICTION LOGIC 1. Store start date of each period 2. Calculate
average cycle length from last 3–6 cycles 3. Predict next period = last
start date + average cycle length 4. Ovulation ≈ 14 days before
predicted period 5. Phase detection based on day index within cycle 6.
Recalculate after each new entry

DASHBOARD COMPONENTS - Next period countdown - Current cycle phase -
Calendar view - Symptom log form - Cycle history chart - Reminder
settings

DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP

Phase 1 — Setup - Initialize MERN project - Configure MongoDB -
Implement authentication

Phase 2 — Core Tracking - Cycle CRUD operations - Dashboard UI -
Calendar component

Phase 3 — Prediction Engine - Average cycle calculation - Phase
detection logic - Prediction display

Phase 4 — Notifications - Reminder scheduler - Email or push
notifications

Phase 5 — Production Ready - Validation and error handling - Security
hardening - Deployment

SECURITY - Password hashing with bcrypt - JWT token authentication -
HTTPS enforcement - Input validation - Rate limiting

DEPLOYMENT Frontend: Vercel or Netlify Backend: Render or Railway
Database: MongoDB Atlas

FUTURE FEATURES - AI-based prediction refinement - Health report
export - Wearable integration - Anonymous mode - Doctor sharing link
